## Abstract (Draft)

This draft paper evaluates a policy intervention in an epidemiology context using a quasi-experimental design.
The current version is machine-generated and should be treated as a pre-review working draft.

## Policy Question

How does the intervention affect the selected health outcome, and through which equity channels are effects distributed?

## Identification Strategy

Primary design: **Synthetic DiD**.

Planned checks:

1. Event-time dynamics
2. Placebo or falsification tests
3. Heterogeneity by socioeconomic vulnerability
4. Sensitivity to alternative clustering levels

## Data Sources

- Public health surveillance source (to be finalized)
- Policy implementation registry (to be finalized)
- Geospatial and demographic covariates (to be finalized)

## Limitations (Preliminary)

- Potential measurement error in administrative coding.
- Potential spillovers across geographic boundaries.
- External validity may be limited outside observed settings.

## Reproducibility

Run analysis script:

```bash
Rscript scripts/analysis.R
```
